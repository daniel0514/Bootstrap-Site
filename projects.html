                        <p>OneClickUpload is an Android app, written in Android Studio, to upload photos to multiple social media accounts at the same time. Currently, the app only implements two social media APIs (Facebook and Twitter). Android's built-in database, SQLite, is utilized in the app to persist user data such as Upload Profiles, preventing the loss of user created profiles between app closes.  When the app is opened, the profile information is then retrieved from the database and being unmarshalled into objects for use.

                    <p>Ever had the situation when you arrive at the restaurant but unable to find a parking spot nearby? You are in luck! ParkNEat will find nearby parking spots for you (however we do not guarantee the spot is empty). ParkNEat is a web application that locates restaurants near you (or a location of your choice) and display the parking spots near the restaurants of your choice. ParkNEat also allows you to see comments and rating from other users. So what are you waiting for? Start using ParkNEat</p>
                    <p>ParkNEat is developed in Java (with Eclipse IDE) and Google Web Toolkit. The web application uses Yelp's API to retrieve locations of restaurants, and parking locations are obtained from datasets from <a href="http://data.vancouver.ca" target="_blank">City of Vancouver Open Data Catalogue</a>. Those data are then stored onto Google's NoSQL database for persistence. When needed, data is retrieved from the database and being displayed. Other types of data include user generated restaurant rating and reviews (not from Yelp). To display locations on a map, we integrated Google Map API and put the locations of restaurants and parking locations on the map. Twitter API is included for users to tweet about the experience with ParkNEat.  </p>
